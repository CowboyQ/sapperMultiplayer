# Sapper Multiplayer
An old HS project: a multiplayer version of sapper, based on node.js, three.js and mongo. Playable up to 2 players over the local network!

## Setup
- Install node.js into the folder
- Boot up mongo with 'mongo' and 'mongod' commands (from 'mongoDirectory/version/bin')
- Start the server with 'node server.js'
- Open up browser, type in 'localhost:3000/index.html' and voila, it's done!

Note: I'm not the author of Three.js (obviously).
